# Geospatial data

Geospatial data, or geodata, is special data that is distinguished from other types of data by its explicit link to a location on the earth's surface (spatial reference). Many data can be described as geodata, and they are invaluable for a wide range of applications. In this field the data.public.lu portal collaborates closely with the [national Geoportal](https://www.geoportail.lu), the [cartographic portal](https://map.geoportail.lu), the [INSPIRE catalogue of the Grand Duchy](https://catalog.inspire.geoportail.lu/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home) as well as the [atlas of the Greater Region](https://gr-atlas.uni.lu/atlas/fr/start.html).

The most popular dataset at the moment is: [National 3D building database](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/base-de-donnees-nationale-des-batiments-3d/)

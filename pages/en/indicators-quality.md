# Improve the metadata quality score

A metadata quality score has been set up on data.public.lu to mainly address two issues:

* Data reusers struggle to identify quality datasets and assess whether a particular dataset is worthy of interest;
* Data producers are not sufficiently encouraged and supported to improve the quality of their data.

Thanks to this metadata quality score, **it is possible to identify the areas on which to work to improve the quality of your data**.

ðŸ§­ The criteria are as follows:&#x20;

| Criterion | Description |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data description | The description of the data is of quality (the description of the dataset is sufficiently long). |
| Documented resources | Presence of at least one documentation type file or sufficiently long description of the files. |
| Update | <p>- The update frequency is specified.<br>- The update frequency is respected.</p> |
| License | <p>- The license is specified.<br>- The license is open.<br><a href="https://data.public.lu/en/pages/fact-sheets/licenses/">See our information sheet on licenses</a>.</p> |
| Resource metadata | Presence of at least one resource with a declared open format. |
| Spatial coverage | <p>- The spatial coverage is specified.<br>- The spatial granularity is specified.</p> |
| Temporal coverage | The temporal coverage of the data is specified. |

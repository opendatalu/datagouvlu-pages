## 1\. GENERAL


### 1.1 Obligations of the user


Access to this site is via the Internet. The user declares that he/she is aware of the risks and accepts them. They must protect themselves against the effects of computer piracy by adopting a suitable and secure computer configuration.

The State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shall not be held liable for any damage that the user may suffer directly or indirectly in connection with browsing this site and using its services and the Internet sites to which it refers.

### 1.2 Cookie management

This site may use client cookies, small text files that make it possible to analyse information relating to the user's browsing (frequency of visits, duration of visits, pages consulted, linguistic preferences, etc.). They are deposited by this site in a directory provided for this purpose on the user's computer. They contain, in particular, the name of the server that wrote it, an identifier in the form of a unique number and an expiry date. The unique identifier enables this site to recognise the user's computer each time it visits.

The user himself can decide whether or not the web server of this site is allowed to store cookies on his computer. The user may at any time set the options of his browser so that cookies are not accepted and stored. Furthermore, he/she can delete already stored cookies at any time via the browser.

The use of certain features of this site may be limited or disabled if the user refuses the site's cookies. It is therefore recommended that the user set his/her browser to accept cookies from the site.

### 1.3. Modification of the site


The State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg reserves the right to change, modify or suspend, at any time and without prior notice, this site and these general conditions for reasons of maintenance, updating, changes in legislation, or for any other reason deemed necessary. In particular, the State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may at any time withdraw, add to, complete or clarify all or part of the information and services contained or offered on the site. The State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shall not be held liable for any direct or indirect damage in connection with such modifications.

It is the user's responsibility to inform himself/herself of the general conditions of use of this site, of which only the updated version accessible online is deemed to be in force.

### 1.4. Limitations of liability

The State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will do its utmost to ensure maximum availability of this site.

The State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will do its utmost to ensure the security of the computer system. However, it shall not be held liable in the event of an attack on the computer system or the temporary or total unavailability of the site.

The State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will do its utmost to ensure the accuracy of the information or services contained on this site.

For the convenience of users, this site may contain links to other sites that may be useful or of interest to them.

Any dispute relating to the use of this site and its Services shall be subject to Luxembourg law and shall fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

## 2\. PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA


### 2.1. General

Personal data provided by the user shall be processed in accordance with [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data

The State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg does not collect any personal data when visiting websites apart from IP addresses in the web server logs for security reasons, so user consent is not required before visiting this portal.

The person responsible for this processing is the body responsible for this portal, i.e. the Government Information and Press Service (SIP).

Users may submit complaints regarding the protection of their data via the respective communication channels provided and to the body responsible for this portal, the Government Information and Press Service (SIP). The user may also file a complaint with the data protection officer of the Agency via the following e-mail address: dataprotection@sip.etat.lu. The user may also contact the [National Commission for Data Protection] (https://cnpd.public.lu/en.html), whose registered office is at 15, Boulevard du Jazz, L-4370 Belvaux, for any dispute in this area.

The user's data are recorded and processed by the SIP solely for the purpose of managing the procedures concerned. Access to these data is strictly limited to the persons of the SIP who have been defined as responsible for this processing. Under no circumstances are these data used for commercial purposes or communicated to third parties. The data may be rendered anonymous for statistical or historical purposes.

The data are stored for as long as they remain necessary for the fulfilment of the above-mentioned purposes.

The SIP and the Land Registry and Surveying Administration, which hosts and operates the portal, take all precautionary measures to ensure data security, taking into account the more or less sensitive nature of the data. However, they cannot rule out all the risks associated with the use of the Internet.

### 2.2. Creation of an account

The creation of an account only requires the user's first and last names and an e-mail address. The data freely deposited on the site are either data sets intended to be published to the general public or cases of re-use of these data.

In accordance with the Data Protection Act, the user may access his/her personal data, modify them, request their deletion or object to any processing of data. To exercise these rights, the user may contact the SIP using the contact details at the bottom of this page.

### 2.3. Processing related to audience measurement

Certain data relating to the user's hardware and software which are not of an identifiable nature are collected when the user visits the public portal. The sole purpose of this collection is to obtain statistics on the number of visits (type of browser, resolution, approximate location, etc.) in order to provide users with the best possible service.

The user's full IP address is not stored under any circumstances. Only part of the IP address is kept in order to obtain global statistics and in no case is it possible to identify a user.

This data is stored and hosted in Europe in a solution provided by a subcontractor, namely Adobe Systems Inc. which, as a subcontractor, is subject to the same legal obligations concerning the protection of personal data in the event that such data is collected in the future.

The duration of data retention does not exceed that necessary to observe the evolution of audiences according to the evolution of browsers, resolutions used, or other available statistical data.

The person responsible for this processing is the organisation responsible for this site.


### 2.4. Processing related to online surveys

User data is collected on a voluntary basis for the sole purpose of conducting surveys for government agencies. In addition, technical audience measurement data is collected at the same time.

The data is stored for the duration of the survey, plus a few weeks for statistical analysis of the results.

These surveys are carried out directly on the site of a subcontractor, namely alchemer.eu from Alchemer LLC, based in the United States. The data is hosted in Europe. The latter is subject to the same legal obligations regarding the protection of personal data when surveys are intended for or carried out by users from the European Union.

The procedures for implementing these surveys are such that no data is of a nature to identify the user in person. The combination of technical identification data (IP address or information on the user's browser or device), and/or data from several surveys cannot lead to such identification by the subcontractor operating the platform.

The person responsible for this processing and the recipient of the data is the Organization responsible for this site that commissioned the survey.

### 2.5. Processing linked to newsletter management

The e-mail address entered when subscribing to the newsletter on this site will be communicated solely for the purposes of newsletter distribution to a subcontractor, namely the company "Mailjet" based in Paris, France, which is subject to the same legal obligations concerning the protection of personal data. To limit abuse, users must validate their registration by clicking on a link sent to the e-mail address provided.

Users may unsubscribe at any time by clicking on the link provided in each e-mail or by contacting the organization responsible for the site. The user's data will be kept for no longer than two weeks following the unsubscribe request, except in cases where partial or total conservation of the data is required by the data controller, in compliance with the relevant legal obligations.

The data controller is the organization responsible for this site.

### 2.6. Code of conduct and responsibilities of contributors

#### 2.6.1. Publication of a dataset or reuse

The data.public.lu Portal disseminates Public Information and data of public interest published by Contributors which can be made available for download, via an API or referenced by a link.

The Platform is not intended to disseminate advertising data, promotion of private interests, contravening public order or, more generally, illicit. The SIP may, if necessary, without prior notice, delete or make impossible the access to such data.

Contributors are solely responsible for the data, metadata or content they publish on the Platform.

#### 2.6.2. Datasets containing personal data

Datasets containing personal data, i.e. data, including non-nominative data, allowing the re-identification of natural persons, may not be disseminated by the Platform unless the persons concerned have given their consent or if a legal provision allows it.

The Contributor publishing the Dataset is responsible for the datasets he/she publishes on the Platform and ensures that this publication is in compliance with the applicable legislation.

The Re-user of such data must comply with the legislation on the protection of personal data in force in its territory of residence and respect the relevant stipulations of the licence attached to such data.

#### 2.6.3. Use of the Forum

The messages published on the Forum by the Contributor are under his full and entire responsibility. This content is public and the Contributor must not publish information contrary to the rules of data protection of users. The Information and Press Service will not ensure a posteriori moderation of the data published by the Contributor. In order to implement this moderation, any user is invited to contact the Information and Press Service to report inappropriate content.

# Making a request to reuse public data

Any dataset within the scope of the [Open data law of 29 November 2021](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2021/11/29/a836/jo) can be requested for reuse if it is not yet published and made available under an open licence.

The applicant can contact either directly the concerned administration or the open data portal team at this address: info@data.public.lu

Before making any reuse request, please check that the data you are looking for is not already available on the Open Data Portal through its [search function](/en/datasets/).
A reuse request is not an [information access request](https://guichet.public.lu/fr/citoyens/citoyennete/acces-information/acces-informations-institutions/communication-document-administrations.html).

The [list of previous requests](/en/datasets/requests-for-publication-of-data-in-open-data/) managed by the portal team is available in open data.
